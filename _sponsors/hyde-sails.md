moreInfo: "Like many of the successful sail lofts in the world, Hyde Sails grew from racing and in particular racing one-design dinghies. The need to eke out small differences in performance between identical boats imposes values of quality and discipline in the manufacture of sails that are not so important in other branches of sailmaking."
