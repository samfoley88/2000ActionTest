29th April 2020

We've had the following update from Brixham YC regarding the Nationals and the Covid-19 situation:-

1\. Assuming the current restrictions are lifted, we will definitely help where we can with the social distancing, catering etc. Our chef Lee has continued working through the crisis providing delivery and take away to members. He has proven nothing will stop him.

2\. We are very much following the RYA guidance at the moment in terms of events, training etc. Their current guidance is that events should be cancelled until at least 31st May. We will let you know if and when their guidance changes or the club makes any further decisions. We are all fully committed to getting the club back to running events and getting people back out onto the water as soon as we safely can.

3\. With regards to local accommodation, most are still taking bookings from June onwards with the obvious disclaimer that restrictions may not be lifted by the government. Have checked the Century Road campsite and they are taking bookings for the period but also showing a low availability. The Quayside Hotels seem to have quite a few rooms available for the period, the berry head hotel responding to email only at the moment. We have a list of local accommodation here:

PLEASE NOTE that the 2020 Nationals at Brixham are restricted to just 70 boats and as at 25 February 2020 we have 40 entries confirmed so don't delay your entry.

If you later decide you have to vacate your place it is possible another boat will substitute for you.
