Try this race on Sunday: The Lockdown Upwind Downwind

If you can sail your 2000 on Sunday try this distance race against all your other 2000 Friends

Current restrictions mean that traditional open meetings have had to be cancelled, and club racing is severely curtailed.  
The 2000 Class Association would like to introduce the ‘2000 distance event’.  
This is a real sailing event, and we hope more and more people can join in as clubs and water areas gradually open.  
The ‘event’ can be undertaken at any location, and at any time each Sunday.  
Clearly this means that the varying weather across the UK may well have a major impact on the results, but in these strange times, it is good to just be on the water.  
2000 distance event  
1\. A windward/leeward course must be sailed.  
2\. The course can be any length, as long as it comprises one windward and one leeward mark. At least one windward and one leeward leg must be completed within the 45 minute period.  
3\. Sailors are to record the distance sailed in 45 minutes while sailing the windward/leeward course.  
4\. Send helm/crew info, plus boat number and club, along with the distance sailed, and a screenshot of a GPS track (to prove the course and distance). Send to sailsec@2000class.org by 1800 on the Monday after sailing.  
5\. GPS tracks can be created by any GPS watch or smartphone system as long as it shows the 45 minute time and the distance sailed, along with a track.  
6\. The 45 minute period can be repeated as many times as you wish, but the track submitted must be a continuous 45 minute period.  
Who will get the furthest distance at your club, or in your area, or across the country?  
Join in for some 2000 fun while we await more traditional events in the future.  
Important; Ensure that you comply with all Government, National, and club, guidelines and restrictions when taking part in this ‘event’.
