title: Boat Sail Numbers & Year of Registration

---
The issue of sail numbers has not always been strictly sequential, but the following can be used as a general guideline:

**1998** 2000 - 2152

**1999** 2153 - 2364

**2000** 2365 - 2546

**2001** 2547 - 2786

**2002** 2787 - 2999 then 21000 - 21060

**2003** 21061 - 21276

**2004** 21277 - 21515

**2005** 21516 - 21733

**2006** 21734 - 21951

**2007** 21952 - 22098

**2008** 22099 - 22235

**2009** 22236 - 22274

**2010** 22275 - 22310

**2011** 22311 - 22343

**2012** 22344 - 22370 (approx)

**2013** 22501 - 22517

**2014** 22518 -

Consider though - a boat registered late in the year will possibly not be sailed until the following season, so a boat registered late 2001 may not have been first sailed until 2002. The condition of the hull, fittings, rigging, foils and sails will also be an indication of the boats use or how well it has been maintained and cared for.

**Note:** From 1998 to 2012 the boat was known as the 'Laser 2000' and the licensed builder was Performance Sailcraft Europe, subsequently trading as LaserPerformance Europe. From 2013 onwards the licensed builder is LDC Sailing and new boats will be marketed as the '2000'.
