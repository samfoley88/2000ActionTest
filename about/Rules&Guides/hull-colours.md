Not sure what colour your boat is? The original Laser 2000 was produced in a range of colours. The most common topsides are Purple, Navy Blue and Race Blue, but examples of Yellow, Charcoal Grey and Vela Grey (generally known as 'White') boats can also be found.

So far as we know, the deck moulding and hull below waterline have always been Vela Grey, except for the Purple boats which we believe were Dawn Grey.

Very approximately:

Purple boats were produced 1998 - 1999, Sail numbers 2000 - 2160.

Navy Blue boats were produced 1999 - 2000 Sail numbers 2160 - 2500.

Race Blue boats were produced from 2001 to 2011, Sail numbers 2500 onwards.

..... with overlaps and with other colours interspersed, i.e Yellow boats around Sail No 2400, Charcoal Grey around Sail No 21000 and 'White' boats more recently.

**From 2013 onwards LDC Sailing will be manufacturing the 2000 in a limited range of colours as below.**
