be accompanied then the Secretary should be informed at the time the initial request for a
hearing is made. After presentation of all details in the matter, at a hearing or otherwise, a
period for evaluation will take place (maximum two weeks), after which the individual
concerned will be notified of the final outcome. The Committee must be seen to be acting as
independently/objectively as possible during this process.
(d) A Member will not be entitled to the return of any part of their subscription in respect of the
period for which they are suspended from membership.
Interpretations
AGM 2002: The individual is the Association member and not the boat.
AGM 2005: Group and Corporate Members shall receive one copy/edition of all mailings (e.g.
Millennium Mutterings).</li>
