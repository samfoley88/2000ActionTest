title: About the 2000 Class Association

---
The 2000 Class Association is made up of 2000-dinghy sailors. The 2000, formerly known as the Laser 2000, is an entry-level performance asymmetric sailing dinghy. It is equally suitable for cruisers, families as well as serious racers.

2000 Class Association members are a friendly bunch. We like to share our tips and advice with our colleagues and encourage potential buyers to join us. As a racing fleet, we are competitive but supportive of less experienced sailors. We also try to arrange a complimentary social programme, meeting other 2000 owners and having a good evening in the club after a hard day's sailing. As a cruising fleet, we meet up with all our families, have BBQs, treasure hunts and sail around the venue. Either way - with us, it's all about having fun with the 2000.

Joining the Class Association is easy, all you need to do is download and fill out an Application Form, write a cheque for Â£20 and send it to the Membership Secretary using the address on the form. Should you have any queries these can also be addressed to the Membership Secretary.

The Association is here to protect your interests, we oversee the class rules - making sure that any changes that do come about do not greatly depreciate the value of the older boats. We play an active role with Laser in examining any proposed modifications to the boat or its equipment so that any potential changes do not significantly alter the competitiveness of the one-design boat.

Throughout the year articles are written and collated for the Association's publication - Millennium Mutterings. This is delivered FREE to all members and includes stories of general interest and reports from events. If you have an article you would like to share with everyone then please contact our Editor.

This website is also maintained to keep you up to date on all the news and events. 

One of the Association's functions is to promote class racing. We do this by organising a number of open meetings called the "Millennium Series" throughout the season, and a National Championship event each year. Racing is open to all Class Association members and is there to help you get the best out of your 2000. During these meetings we frequently pass around information and tips on rigging/sailing and the best ones get posted to this site.

If you think that you are not good enough to come to the Open meetings, think again! You may not win your first race but it is far quicker to improve your boat handling skills and learn how to make your boat go faster alongside other 2000s than it is trying to learn tricks off an RS200 or GP14!

We also encourage cruising. The 2000 is a good family boat, very stable and suitable for all the family. Dependent on interest, we can arrange events on either inland waters or at coastal venues. These events are geared towards family fun, allowing everyone to relax and enjoy time both on and off the water, very often camping next to the water. The meetings are very flexible and you can join in as much or as little as you like.
